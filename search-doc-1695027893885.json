The very first message that has to be sent on either of the WebSocket connections (peer to Jellyfish oryour_backend_server to Jellyfish) is AuthRequest. All supported messages are listed in the Jellyfish protos repo. If you want to create your own Jellyfish SDK, the easiest way to reference defined protobuf messages will be by adding protos to your git repository as a git submodule. You can do it with this command: git submodule add https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/protos You could also consider creating a script that will pull the newest changes from the git submodule and compile.proto files to your chosen programming language.

Because, in this scenario, the delay is not the most crucial thing, we choose HLS. The most important thing here is that the RTSP component connects to the IP camera and then the camera starts streaming. It's not the camera that initializes the connection to the server. Therefore, the RTSP component is a purely server-side thing - once you add it, it should be able to work on its own.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track. "},{"title":"Connecting and joining the room​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Minimal Working Example","url":"/jellyfish-docs/tutorials/minimal-working-example-react#connecting-and-joining-the-room","content":"The general flow of connecting to the server and joining the room in a standard WebRTC conference setup looks like this:  The parts that you need to implement are marked in blue and things handled by Jellyfish are marked in red. Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish The dashboard looks like this:  You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the user and Jellyfish Client.

In this tutorial, You've learned how to make a basic Jellyfish client application that streams your screen and receives video tracks with WebRTC technology. But this was just the beginning. Jellyfish Client supports much more than just streaming camera: It can also stream audio or your device's camera, configure your camera and audio devices, detect voice activity, control simulcast, bandwidth and encoding settings, show camera preview, display WebRTC stats and more to come. Check out our other tutorials to learn about those features. You can also take a look at our fully featured Videoroom Demo example:  "}]

You can do this with JF_PORT and JF_METRICS_PORT environment variables. Distribution Environment Variables List of all cluster-related environment variables is available here. Security Currently, Jellyfish distribution is not encrypted meaning that data between Jellyfishes is sent as plain text. Cookie does not provide any cryptographic security. Do run a cluster only across machines in the same network! Extra network Configuration Jellyfish leverages Erlang Distribution to form a cluster. This means that we don't need to use any database where we would store information about network topology. Instead, some extra network configuration might be needed. Jellyfish uses a service called EPMD (Erlang Port Mapper Deamon) that runs on port 4369 (TCP). If you run Jellyfish using Docker, you have to explicitly export this port. In production deployment, you also have to allow for traffic on this port in your firewall. EPMD is started automatically when running Jellyfish, so you don't need to take any extra steps to make it work. Jellyfish uses a random port for connecting to other Jellyfishes. If you run Jellyfish using Docker, this port defaults to 9000 (TCP) but you can configure the range it is selected from with JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT. Note that JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT are not available when running from source (using mix phx.server) as in development you don't have to worry about the port used for forming a cluster. As in the case of EPMD, in production deployment, you have to modify your firewall rules appropriately. See Deeper dive into Erlang Distribution for more information.

EPMD is responsible for mapping node names to ports they use. Node names consist of two parts nodename@hostname.hostname identifies a host machine, and nodename identifies a node on this machine. When node A wants to connect to node B, it uses node's B name to ask EPMD (running on node B) for the actual port node B is accessible on. Example Let's assume that node's B name is nodeb@192.168.1.2.Node A will contact EPMD using 192.168.1.2 IP address and port 4369, and ask for the port number used by a node with the name nodeb.After that, node A can contact node B using 192.168.1.2 IP address and port returned by EPMD.

Therefore, we don't present them here but rather in each peer/component's documentation. As an example see WebRTC Peer. For the full list of Jellyfish Docker images, see this page. tip Instead of passing environmental variables manually, you can use the --env-file ./env-file flag, where the env-file is a file containing the variables that the image expects, see example file .env.sample in the Jellyfish repository.

They are always listed in a Peer/Component description. See the list of Peers and Components. Below there are general, Jellyfish environment variables. If you are running Jellyfish in development, you don't need to set any of them. Required in production:​ JF_SERVER_API_TOKEN - token for authorizing HTTP requests. Defaults to development for development builds.JF_HOST - defines how Jellyfish should be seen from the outside. Defaults to JF_IP:JF_PORT. It can be in the form of ip:port, domain:port or simply domain. Useful when hosting Jellyfish behind proxy. It is returned e.g. when creating a new room. When running with Docker, JF_IP is set to 0.0.0.0making the default value of JF_HOST incorrect. Therefore, for Docker, you have to set JF_HOST manually. For running Docker locally, it can simply be localhost:8080. Optional:​ JF_IP - an ip address to run the HTTP server on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 when running from source or using mix release, or 0.0.0.0 for Docker.JF_PORT - port to run the HTTP server on. Defaults to 5002 for development builds and 8080 for production builds (mix release or Docker).JF_SECRET_KEY_BASE - used to sign/encrypt tokens generated for Peers. Generated if not provided.JF_CHECK_ORIGIN - defines if Jellyfish will check origin of incoming requests and socket connection. Defaults to true. Can be true or false.JF_OUTPUT_BASE_PATH - a base path where Jellyfish will save its artifacts. Defaults to ./jellyfish_output/. When running via docker, the directory can be mounted as -v $(pwd)/host_directory:/app/jellyfish_output.JF_METRICS_IP - an IP address to run metrics endpoint on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 when running from source or using mix release, or 0.0.0.0 for Docker.JF_METRICS_PORT - a port to run metrics endpoint on. Defaults to 9568.MIX_ENV - defines compilation environment. This variable takes effect only when running from the source. Docker images are always built with MIX_ENV=prod. Possible values are: dev - uses default values for environment variables (default option when running with mix phx.server)prod - requires that you provide values for environment variablestest - used in tests Distribution:​ JF_DIST_ENABLED - whether to run Jellyfish in a cluster. Defaults to false.JF_DIST_NODE_NAME - Node name used in a cluster. It consists of two parts - nodename@hostname. The first part identifies a node on a single machine and can be any string. The second part identifies the host machine and has to be an ip address or FQDN of a machine Jellyfish runs on. If you run a cluster on a single machine or in the same docker network and you don't want to use IP addresses or FQDN as hostnames, you can use short names (see JF_DIST_MODE).JF_DIST_MODE - distribution mode - can be name or sname. Defaults to name. When using name, your hostname has to be an IP address or FQDN of a machine Jellyfish runs on. When using sname, your hostname can be any string. See our docker-compose.yaml, which we use in our integration tests for an example.JF_DIST_COOKIE - used to group Jellyfishes in a cluster. Defaults to jellyfish_cookie. Use different cookies to create multiple clusters on the same machine. Important: cookie does not provide any cryptographic security. Its only purpose is to prevent a node from connecting to a cluster with which it is not intended to communicate.JF_DIST_NODES - space-separated list of other Jellyfishes to connect to. Defaults to &quot;&quot;. Example: JF_DIST_NODES=&quot;jellyfish1@127.0.0.1 jellyfish2@127.0.0.1&quot;. This list can also include ourselves so that you can pass the same value to every Jellyfish. Note: Jellyfish connection to other Jellyfish is transitive meaning that when you connect to one Jellyfish you also connect to all other Jellyfishes this one was connected to.JF_DIST_MIN_PORT- minimal port used by Jellyfish when forming a cluster (connecting to other Jellyfishes). Defaults to 9000 when running with Docker. Only available when running with Docker or mix release.JF_DIST_MAX_PORT- maximal port used by Jellyfish when forming a cluster (connecting to other Jellyfishes). Defaults to 9000 when running with Docker. Only available when running with Docker or mix release. tip You can use a single port to form a cluster, even if a cluster consists of more than two Jellyfishes. caution Besides ports specified using JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT, Jellyfish also uses one more service called EPMD that runs on port 4369. This port has to be explicitly exported when running with Docker. Read more in the Cluster section.

Jellyfish Client API is a powerful tool that allows you to create your own web or mobile multimedia application. Check out the other tutorials to learn more about the Jellyfish Client API and how to use it in your projects. You can also take a look at our fully featured Videoroom Demo example:  It's written in React Native, but it uses the same Jellyfish Client API as the dashboard, so you can learn a lot from it.

Values for mean incoming throughput, mean and peak outgoing throughput, peak memory used, peak CPU utilisation and mean request latency (grouped by request type) were all recorded. Before any clients were connected to the server, the memory usage stood at 130 MB and CPU utilisation was noted at 11%. These values serve as the base or idle state of the server for comparison against the usage under stress testing. info It's important to remember that, in the context of HLS, the outgoing throughput is greatly influenced by the bitrate of the generated segments, which is directly connected to the bitrate of the streams used for segment generation. Specifically, for video streams featuring high and fluctuating bitrates (such as sports events and video game live streams) you may typically observe amplified mean and peak outgoing throughputs. Caveat Values italicised in the Latency columns indicate instances where network bandwidth limits were reached, resulting in throttling; in such cases, the observed latency does not reflect the server's innate processing capabilities.

When node A wants to connect to node B, it uses node's B name to ask EPMD (running on node B) for the actual port node B is accessible on. Example Let's assume that node's B name is nodeb@192.168.1.2.Node A will contact EPMD using 192.168.1.2 IP address and port 4369, and ask for the port number used by a node with the name nodeb.After that, node A can contact node B using 192.168.1.2 IP address and port returned by EPMD.

Some could be worried about the cardinality of this type of metric. To answer these worries, we have to deepen our knowledge about Prometheus metrics. Each unique labelset creates a separate time series. Each additional time series has RAM, CPU, disk, and network costs. This cost is usually negligible, but when we talk about hundreds of servers and metrics, it can add up quickly. But the question is, how quickly will this add up? At the moment (16.11.2023), Prometheus can handle around ten million time series. Prometheus maintainers suggest that when analyzing the capacity of Prometheus, we should think about a cluster where one Prometheus instance monitors around 1000 servers. Default retention in Prometheus is 15 days, meaning time series older than 15 days are removed. Based on this assumption, we can approximate how many rooms per hour on each of 1000 jellyfish for 15 days straight must be created to reach Prometheus limits. room_per_hour_on_jellyfish = = total_time_series_limit / number_of_jellyfishes / prometheus_retention_in_days / hours_in_day = = 10_000_000 / 1_000 / 15 / 24 = 27 This limit is pretty high and, in most use cases, shouldn't be a problem. But to be cautious, we will add this label only to metrics where that is required, and we will try to minimize the amount of metrics where that is used. If this label is a problem for you, there are a few solutions: We are thinking about adding a possibility to configurable disable metrics that use the label room_id, but it is not in our current roadmapYou can define in Prometheus that at the scrape time, some labels will be dropped from metrics. (Remember that label dropping should be done cautiously as it could lead to the dropping of some data or aggregation).Similarly to previous in Prometheus, at the scrape time, you can define to drop some specific metric. To get more information about relabeling, metrics or label dropping we suggest to read grafana tutorial.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track.

Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track.

Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish The dashboard looks like this:  You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the user and Jellyfish Client.

"},{"title":"Environment variables​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"/jellyfish-docs/next/getting_started/installation#environment-variables","content":"Environment variables are split into two groups: general ones - presented belowpeer/component-specific - each Peer and Component can expose its own environment variables. They are always listed in a Peer/Component description. See the list of Peers and Components. Below there are general, Jellyfish environment variables. If you are running Jellyfish in development, you don't need to set any of them. Required in production:​ JF_SERVER_API_TOKEN - token for authorizing HTTP requests. Defaults to development for development builds.JF_HOST - defines how Jellyfish should be seen from the outside. Defaults to JF_IP:JF_PORT. It can be in the form of ip:port, domain:port or simply domain. Useful when hosting Jellyfish behind proxy. It is returned e.g. when creating a new room. When running with Docker, JF_IP is set to 0.0.0.0making the default value of JF_HOST incorrect. Therefore, for Docker, you have to set JF_HOST manually. For running Docker locally, it can simply be localhost:8080. Optional:​ JF_IP - an ip address to run the HTTP server on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 when running from source or using mix release, or 0.0.0.0 for Docker.JF_PORT - port to run the HTTP server on. Defaults to 5002 for development builds and 8080 for production builds (mix release or Docker).JF_SSL_KEY_PATH - an absolute path to the SSL key. When both JF_SSL_KEY_PATH and JF_SSL_CERT_PATH are set, Jellyfish will run HTTPS server instead of HTTP one. An address where this server listens to is still configured via JF_IP and JF_PORT.JF_SSL_CERT_PATH - an absolute path the the SSL certificate. When both JF_SSL_KEY_PATH and JF_SSL_CERT_PATH are set, Jellyfish will run HTTPS server instead of HTTP one. An address where this server listens to is still configured via JF_IP and JF_PORT.JF_SECRET_KEY_BASE - used to sign/encrypt tokens generated for Peers. Generated if not provided.JF_CHECK_ORIGIN - defines if Jellyfish will check the origin of incoming requests and socket connection. Defaults to true. Possible values are true, false or a space-separated list of allowed origins (wildcards are allowed). Example: JF_CHECK_ORIGIN=&quot;https://example.com //another.com:888 //*.other.com&quot;JF_RESOURCES_BASE_PATH - a base path where Jellyfish multimedia files are stored Defaults to ./jellyfish_resources/. When running via docker, the directory can be mounted as -v $(pwd)/host_directory:/app/jellyfish_resources.JF_METRICS_IP - an IP address to run metrics endpoint on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 when running from source or using mix release, or 0.0.0.0 for Docker.JF_METRICS_PORT - a port to run metrics endpoint on. Defaults to 9568.MIX_ENV - defines compilation environment. This variable takes effect only when running from the source. Docker images are always built with MIX_ENV=prod. Possible values are: dev - uses default values for environment variables (default option when running with mix phx.server)prod - requires that you provide values for environment variablestest - used in tests Distribution:​ JF_DIST_ENABLED - whether to run Jellyfish in a cluster. Defaults to false.JF_DIST_STRATEGY_NAME - specify which clustering strategy to use. Possible values are DNS or NODES_LIST. Defaults to NODES_LIST.JF_DIST_NODE_NAME - Node name used in a cluster. Defaults to jellyfish@(hostname). It consists of two parts - nodename@hostname. The first part identifies a node on a single machine and can be any string. The second part identifies the host machine jellyfish runs on and has to be resolvable. Its format depends on JF_DIST_MODE. If JF_DIST_MODE is set to name, the hostname has to be an IP address or FQDN. If JF_DIST_MODE is set to sname, the hostname can be any string. If you run a cluster using DNS strategy, every Jellyfish instance must have nodename set to the same value. If hostname is not an IP address, it will be automatically resolved as DNS strategy requires node names to use IP addresses. This also means that DNS strategy has to be run with JF_DIST_MODE set to name. See our docker-compose-epmd.yaml or docker-compose-dns.yaml, which we use in our integration tests or refer to Cluster section for examples.JF_DIST_MODE - distribution mode - can be name or sname. Defaults to sname. When using name, your hostname has to be an IP address or FQDN of a machine Jellyfish runs on. When using sname, your hostname can be any string. See JF_DIST_NODE_NAME for more information.JF_DIST_COOKIE - used to group Jellyfishes in a cluster. Defaults to jellyfish_cookie. Use different cookies to create multiple clusters on the same machine. Important: cookie does not provide any cryptographic security. Its only purpose is to prevent a node from connecting to a cluster with which it is not intended to communicate.JF_DIST_MIN_PORT- minimal port used by Jellyfish when forming a cluster (connecting to other Jellyfishes). Defaults to 9000 when running with Docker. Only available when running with Docker or mix release.JF_DIST_MAX_PORT- maximal port used by Jellyfish when forming a cluster (connecting to other Jellyfishes). Defaults to 9000 when running with Docker. Only available when running with Docker or mix release. Distribution NODES_LIST specific:​ JF_DIST_NODES - space-separated list of other Jellyfishes to connect to. Defaults to &quot;&quot;. Example: JF_DIST_NODES=&quot;jellyfish1@127.0.0.1 jellyfish2@127.0.0.1&quot;. This list can also include ourselves so that you can pass the same value to every Jellyfish. Note: Jellyfish connection to other Jellyfish is transitive meaning that when you connect to one Jellyfish you also connect to all other Jellyfishes this one was connected to. Distribution DNS specific:​ JF_DIST_QUERY - query sent to DNS to discover other Jellyfishes. Returned list of IPs from DNS is used for creating distribution node name in the format &lt;nodename&gt;@&lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;. JF_DIST_POLLING_INTERVAL - DNS polling interval in ms. Default value is 5000. tip You can use a single port to form a cluster, even if a cluster consists of more than two Jellyfishes. caution Besides ports specified using JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT, Jellyfish also uses one more service called EPMD that runs on port 4369. This port has to be explicitly exported when running with Docker. Read more in the Cluster section.

Here, we choose WebRTC as a standard used for connecting people talking to each other in real-time and HLS for creating a playlist that can be then uploaded to CDN and broadcasted to the broader audience. As you can see, the whole system will automatically adapt to the number of participants talking in real-time. In particular, Jellyfish will handle a scenario with only one streamer out of the box.

IP cameras very often use RTSP for streaming media but browsers don't ship with support for this protocol. Therefore, to display audio and video in a web browser, we have to use either WebRTC or HLS. Because, in this scenario, the delay is not the most crucial thing, we choose HLS. The most important thing here is that the RTSP component connects to the IP camera and then the camera starts streaming. It's not the camera that initializes the connection to the server. Therefore, the RTSP component is a purely server-side thing - once you add it, it should be able to work on its own.

You can do this with JF_PORT and JF_METRICS_PORT environment variables. Distribution Environment Variables List of all cluster-related environment variables is available here. Security Currently, Jellyfish distribution is not encrypted meaning that data between Jellyfishes is sent as plain text. Cookie does not provide any cryptographic security. Do run a cluster only across machines in the same network! Extra network Configuration Jellyfish leverages Erlang Distribution to form a cluster. This means that we don't need to use any database where we would store information about network topology. Instead, some extra network configuration might be needed. Jellyfish uses a service called EPMD (Erlang Port Mapper Deamon) that runs on port 4369 (TCP). If you run Jellyfish using Docker, you have to explicitly export this port. In production deployment, you also have to allow for traffic on this port in your firewall. EPMD is started automatically when running Jellyfish, so you don't need to take any extra steps to make it work. Jellyfish uses a random port for connecting to other Jellyfishes. If you run Jellyfish using Docker, this port defaults to 9000 (TCP) but you can configure the range it is selected from with JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT. Note that JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT are not available when running from source (using mix phx.server) as in development you don't have to worry about the port used for forming a cluster. As in the case of EPMD, in production deployment, you have to modify your firewall rules appropriately. See Deeper dive into Erlang Distribution for more information.

Example Let's assume that node's B name is nodeb@192.168.1.2.Node A will contact EPMD using 192.168.1.2 IP address and port 4369, and ask for the port number used by a node with the name nodeb.After that, node A can contact node B using 192.168.1.2 IP address and port returned by EPMD. A couple of notes about EPMD: it always uses port 4369 (TCP)it is started automatically when running Jellyfishthere is one EPMD per machine or one EPMD per docker container - that's why we can't simulate Global Docker setup locally You can read more about Erlang Distribution here.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track. "},{"title":"Connecting and joining the room​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Simple React App","url":"/jellyfish-docs/next/tutorials/simple-react-app#connecting-and-joining-the-room","content":"The general flow of connecting to the server and joining the room in a standard WebRTC conference setup looks like this:  The parts that you need to implement are marked in blue and things handled by Jellyfish are marked in red. Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish Dashboard looks like this:  You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the user and Jellyfish Client.

It can be in the form of ip:port, domain:port or simply domain. Useful when hosting Jellyfish behind proxy. It is returned e.g. when creating a new room. When running with Docker, JF_IP is set to 0.0.0.0making the default value of JF_HOST incorrect. Therefore, for Docker, you have to set JF_HOST manually.

Defaults to 9568.MIX_ENV - defines compilation environment. This variable takes effect only when running from the source. Docker images are always built with MIX_ENV=prod. Possible values are: dev - uses default values for environment variables (default option when running with mix phx.server)prod - requires that you provide values for environment variablestest - used in tests Distribution:​ JF_DIST_ENABLED - whether to run Jellyfish in a cluster. Defaults to false.JF_DIST_NODE_NAME - Node name used in a cluster. It consists of two parts - nodename@hostname. The first part identifies a node on a single machine and can be any string. The second part identifies the host machine and has to be an ip address or FQDN of a machine Jellyfish runs on. If you run a cluster on a single machine or in the same docker network and you don't want to use IP addresses or FQDN as hostnames, you can use short names (see JF_DIST_MODE).JF_DIST_MODE - distribution mode - can be name or sname. Defaults to name. When using name, your hostname has to be an IP address or FQDN of a machine Jellyfish runs on. When using sname, your hostname can be any string. See our docker-compose.yaml, which we use in our integration tests for an example.JF_DIST_COOKIE - used to group Jellyfishes in a cluster. Defaults to jellyfish_cookie. Use different cookies to create multiple clusters on the same machine. Important: cookie does not provide any cryptographic security. Its only purpose is to prevent a node from connecting to a cluster with which it is not intended to communicate.JF_DIST_NODES - space-separated list of other Jellyfishes to connect to.

Note: Jellyfish connection to other Jellyfish is transitive meaning that when you connect to one Jellyfish you also connect to all other Jellyfishes this one was connected to.JF_DIST_MIN_PORT- minimal port used by Jellyfish when forming a cluster (connecting to other Jellyfishes). Defaults to 9000 when running with Docker. Only available when running with Docker or mix release.JF_DIST_MAX_PORT- maximal port used by Jellyfish when forming a cluster (connecting to other Jellyfishes). Defaults to 9000 when running with Docker. Only available when running with Docker or mix release. tip You can use a single port to form a cluster, even if a cluster consists of more than two Jellyfishes. caution Besides ports specified using JF_DIST_MIN_PORT and JF_DIST_MAX_PORT, Jellyfish also uses one more service called EPMD that runs on port 4369.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track. "},{"title":"Connecting and joining the room​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Native Minimal Working Example","url":"/jellyfish-docs/next/tutorials/react-native#connecting-and-joining-the-room","content":"The general flow of connecting to the server and joining the room in a standard WebRTC conference setup looks like this:  The parts that you need to implement are marked in blue and things handled by Jellyfish are marked in red. Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish Dashboard looks like this:  You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the user and Jellyfish Client.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track. "},{"title":"Connecting and joining the room​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Simple React App","url":"/jellyfish-docs/tutorials/simple-react-app#connecting-and-joining-the-room","content":"The general flow of connecting to the server and joining the room in a standard WebRTC conference setup looks like this:  The parts that you need to implement are marked in blue and things handled by Jellyfish are marked in red. Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish The dashboard looks like this:  You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the user and Jellyfish Client.

This section provides a brief description aimed at front-end developers Let's introduce some concepts first: Peer - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment, there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.Track - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture, transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.Room - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components, its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will be probably one meeting or a broadcast. For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:  In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed. To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one video track. "},{"title":"Connecting and joining the room​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Native Minimal Working Example","url":"/jellyfish-docs/tutorials/react-native#connecting-and-joining-the-room","content":"The general flow of connecting to the server and joining the room in a standard WebRTC conference setup looks like this:  The parts that you need to implement are marked in blue and things handled by Jellyfish are marked in red. Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room for the user. For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish The dashboard looks like this:  You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the user and Jellyfish Client.

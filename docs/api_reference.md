# API Reference

Jellyfish API is composed of three layers
* a REST API for managing Jellyfish state
* a WS connection for client SDK communication (socket path `/socket/peer`) 
* a WS connection for server notifications (socket path `/socket/server`)

You can find them here:
* [OpenAPI REST description](api_reference/rest_api.md)
* [Protobufs used by peer WS](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/protos/blob/master/jellyfish/peer_notifications.proto)
* [Protobufs used by server WS](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/protos/blob/master/jellyfish/server_notifications.proto)

The communication via WebSockets is done with use of [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev) format.
The very first message that has to be sent on either of WebSocket connections (**peer** to **Jellyfish** or 
**your_backend_server** to **Jellyfish**) is `AuthRequest`.
All supported messages are listed in [the Jellyfish protos repo](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/protos).

If you want to create your own Jellyfish SDK, the easiest way to reference to defined protobuf messages 
will be by adding *protos* to your git repository as a git submodule. You can do it with this command:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/protos
```

You could also consider creating a script that will pull newest changes from the git submodule and compile 
*.proto* files to your chosen programming language. 
For reference, see [the script used in our Elixir SDK](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/elixir_server_sdk/blob/master/compile_proto.sh).

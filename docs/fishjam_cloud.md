# Fishjam goes to the Cloud!


After 1.5 years of work we decided to do a pivot and continue the project as [**Fishjam Cloud**](www.cloud.fishjam.stream) making it also closed source.

Fishjam Cloud is a platform that combines years of experience building multimedia solutions, as well as web and mobile apps. Our goal is to lower the bar for building real-time communication-based products, especially for small and medium-sized companies. With no need to run your own multimedia infrastructure, our first-class SDKs help people focus on providing value to customers rather than fighting with technological obstacles.

Our `fishjam-dev` Github organization will remain public but we won't push there any improvements or bugfixes. If you run your product on Fishjam and these changes affect your business, please contact us via projects@swmansion.com.

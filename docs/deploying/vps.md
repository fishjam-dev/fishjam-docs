# Cloud VPS with cloud-init

We're encouraging you to use VPS as the most customizable option.
In this example, we will show you how to set up a Jellyfish media server on [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud), but you can use these instructions to run Jellyfish on VPS from any provider that supports [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) setup.

We're presenting a configuration which uses SSL protocol, as we are aware of the consequences of using unencrypted connections.
That means you're going to need a registered domain but getting one is not a big deal nowadays.

## 1. Creating primary IP

Because configuring a server with _cloud-init_ using our script requires you to have a registered domain pointing at a particular IP address, we divided the process of creating VPS into two parts:
* obtaining dedicated IP address
* configuring the server using _cloud-init_

Let's start with the first one.
In Hetzner's project site go to the section ___Primary IPs___ then click ___Create Primary IP___ button.
Choose a data center location for your server and select __IPv4__ protocol.
You can also name that IP if you'd like.

## 2. Registering Domain

We'll not suggest you to use a specific domain provider, maybe you've got one chosen so we'll describe this step without details that may be different among providers.
If you'd like, [you can use Hetzner as well to register a domain](https://www.hetzner.com/domainregistration).

After registering your domain go to the DNS Records Table of your provider and create an __A__ record pointing to the __IP__ you've created in the previous step.
## 3. Choosing the right VPS

Now let's go back to the Hetzner project site.
It's time to choose and configure a server for Jellyfish.

Although Jellyfish doesn't have minimum requirements to work, we encourage you to choose a middle-sized VPS (at least 8 cores) as media processing is consuming quite a lot of CPU.
Remember to choose a server located in the data center where you've created an IP address in the first step.

For this tutorial, we decided on CPX21 from Hetzner Cloud running Ubuntu 22:

## 4. Assigning Primary IP
Below the list of the VPS types there is a ___Networking___ section where your Primary IP from Step 1 is waiting to be used.
Select it.

## 5. Adding a *cloud-init* configuration

To configure a server and install Jellyfish on it we're going to use *cloud-init*.
It's a preinstalled tool that lets you set up a newly created server with a YAML config file.
In the configuration you can create a user, choose packages to be installed, configure them, write or modify files and in our case finally run a docker container.

Full documentation about keys you can use in a _cloud-config_ file can be found in [the official *cloud-init* documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules.html).


### A ___cloud-config___ tempalte

We prepared a template *cloud-config* that will configure your server and start a chosen version of Jellyfish:

</details>
You'll need to manually take care of four lines in that template:

- `- export JELLYFISH_VERSION=0.1.0-ed317b`
  Change the value if you want to deploy a different version of Jellyfish.
  You can find the list of available versions in [our package repository](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish/pkgs/container/jellyfish)
- `- export JELLYFISH_DOMAIN=mydomain.example.com`
  Enter here a domain you've configured with **A** record in step 2.
- `- export LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=my@email.com`
  Enter your email address to be notified when the SSL certificate will be about to expire.
- `export SERVER_API_TOKEN=test_token`
  Server API token is a token you'll need to connect to Jellyfish via API or SDK.
  Write here a chosen secret value you're going to remember later.

Copy the file and change up those two variables.
You're going to need the content of the file in the next section.

### Other tools we'll install with _cloud-init_

As you might noticed we've chosen some packages to be installed:

- `ufw` -
  Uncomplicated Firewall.
  We'll need it to allow or block traffic on specific ports [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW).
- `fail2ban` -
  Tool to block traffic recognized as unauthorized [https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
- `gzip` -
  Compression Utility [https://www.gzip.org/](https://www.gzip.org/)
- `containerd.io`, `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli` -
  Docker and Docker-related libraries.

### Setting up Hetzner cloud VPS with _cloud-config_

Now, we're going to use the content of the file you prepared in the Hetzner cloud VPS creating form.
To do it scroll to the _Cloud config_ section of the form and paste the content of your _cloud-config.yaml_ file.

![Hetzner Cloud - placing cloud-config](/img/vps-2.png)

:::caution
_cloud-init_ will recognize the file as a configuration only if the file starts with that comment:
```
#cloud-config
...
```
So be careful while copying.
:::

That's it.
You can click 'Create & Buy' and the server will start to configure.

:::tip
Think about adding your public SSH key while creating a VPS instance.
It will ease up connecting to VPS later.
If you don't add any key you're going to need a root password (you'll receive it in an email after creating VPS)
:::

## 6. Checking _cloud-init_ status

Configuring your server will take some time, but it's created almost immediately after creation.
You can log into the server using _ssh_:
```
ssh root@<VPS_IP>
```
then, in the server's terminal you can check the current status of _cloud-init_:

```bash
cloud-init status
```

Possible responses are `running`, `error` and `done`.
The first one informs you that _cloud-init_ is still configuring your server.
The second one means that something went wrong.
You can find logs from the _cloud-init_ run in `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` file.
`done` means that your jellyfish server is ready to be used.

If you'd like to keep an eye on the _cloud-init_ process you can use:

```bash
cloud-init status --wait
```
To see the output when the process is finished (successfully or not).

## Testing your instance with the Jellyfish dashboard

To see how (or if) your Jellyfish server is working you can test it by connecting our [Jellyfish Dashboard](https://jellyfish-dev.github.io/jellyfish-dashboard/) with your server.
Detailed instructions on how to use Jellyfish Dashboard can be found [here](../tutorials/dashboard.mdx).

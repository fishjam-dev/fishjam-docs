# Design Docs

Crucial parts of Jellyfish architecture are always discussed and written down in the form
of design documents.

Each design document describes, in a nutshell, a few possible solutions or approaches to
some problem and states which solution was accepted and why.

The list of Jellyfish Design Docs is available [here](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish/tree/main/docs).

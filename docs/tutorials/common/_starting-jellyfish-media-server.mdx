For testing, we'll run the Jellyfish Media Server locally using Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 50000-50050:50000-50050/udp \
           -p 4000:4000/tcp \
           -e WEBRTC_USED=true \
           -e INTEGRATED_TURN_PORT_RANGE=50000-50050 \
           -e INTEGRATED_TURN_IP=<your ip address> \
           -e INTEGRATED_TURN_LISTEN_IP=0.0.0.0 \
           -e SERVER_API_TOKEN=development \
           -e VIRTUAL_HOST=<your ip address> \
           -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=secret \
           -e PORT="4000" \
           ghcr.io/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish:0.1.0-5e95d59
```

Make sure to set `INTEGRATED_TURN_IP` and `VIRTUAL_HOST` to your local IP address. Without it, the mobile device won't be able to connect to the Jellyfish.

:::tip

To check your local IP you can use this handy command (Linux/macOS):

```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

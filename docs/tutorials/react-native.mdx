# React Native Minimal Working Example

## What you'll learn

This tutorial will guide you through creating your first React Native / Expo
project which uses Jellyfish client. By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a
working application that connects to the front-end dashboard using WebRTC
technology and streams and receives camera tracks.

<ImageWrapper url={'/img/tutorials/rn_full_app.gif'}/>

You can check out the finished project [here](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish-clients-tutorials/tree/main/JellyfishDashboardRN).

## What do you need

- a little bit of experience in creating apps with React Native and/or Expo -
  refer to the [React Native
  Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) or [Expo
  Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/) to learn more

## Jellyfish architecture

<JellyfishArchitecture />

## Setup

### Create React Native / Expo project

Firstly create a brand new project.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">

```bash
npx react-native@latest init JellyfishDashboard
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="expo-bare" label="Expo Bare workflow">

```bash
npx react-native init jellyfish-dashboard --template react-native-template-typescript
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add dependencies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">
    In order for this module to work you'll need to also add `expo` package. The
    expo package has a small footprint and it's necessary as Jellyfish Client
    package is built as Expo module.

```bash npm2yarn
npx install-expo-modules@latest
npm install @jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="expo-bare" label="Expo Bare workflow">

```bash
npx install-expo-modules@latest
npx expo install @jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip
Run `pod install` in the /ios directory to install the new pods
:::

### Native configuration

In order for camera and audio to work you'll need to add some native configuration:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">

You need to at least set up camera permissions.

On Android add to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml title=AndroidManifest.xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

For audio you'll need the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission:

```xml title=AndroidManifest.xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

On iOS you must set `NSCameraUsageDescription` in `Info.plist` file. You can
edit this file in Xcode. This value is a description that is shown when iOS asks user
for camera permission.

```xml title=ios/jellyfish-dashboard/Info.plist
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string> 🙏 🎥 </string>
```

Similarly, for audio there is `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`.

```xml title=ios/jellyfish-dashboard/Info.plist
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string> 🙏 🎤 </string>
```

For screencast there is more configuration needed, it's described [here](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk#ios).

We also suggest setting background mode to `audio` so that the app doesn't
disconnect when it's in the background:

```xml title=ios/jellyfish-dashboard/Info.plist
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

  </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="expo-bare" label="Expo Bare workflow"> 
   
   You have two options here. You can follow configuration instructions for
React Native (Expo Bare workflow is a React Native project after all) or if
you're using `expo prebuild` command to set up native code you can add our Expo
plugin. Just add it to `app.json`:

```json title:app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "example",
    //...
    "plugins": ["@jellyfish-dev/react-native-membrane-webrtc"]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start the Jellyfish backend

<StartingJellyfishBackend />

### Start the dashboard web front-end

<StartingJellyfishDashboard />

## Add components library

For your convenience, we've prepared a library with nice-looking components
useful for following this tutorial. Feel free to use standard React Native components or your own components though!

```bash
npx expo install @expo/vector-icons expo-barcode-scanner expo-font @expo-google-fonts/noto-sans @jellyfish-dev/react-native-jellyfish-components @react-navigation/native-stack
```

**_You'll also need to install [Reanimated library (3.3.0)](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) and [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)_**

## Connecting to the server and joining the room

Our app will consist of two screens. The first one allows the user to type, paste or
scan the peer token and connect to the room. The second screen shows room
participants with their video tracks.

### Screens

For managing screens I've used React Navigation library, you're free though to
use another one. Our app will contain two screens: Connect screen and Room
screen:

```tsx title="/App.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/native-stack";
import ConnectScreen from "./screens/Connect";
import RoomScreen from "./screens/Room";

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Connect" component={ConnectScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Room" component={RoomScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Connect screen

The UI of the Connect screen consists of a simple text input and a few buttons.
The flow for this screen is simple: the user either copies the peer token from the
dashboard or scans it with a QR code scanner and presses Connect button. The QR
code scanner is provided by our components library and it's completely optional,
just for convenience.

The code for the UI looks like this:

```tsx title="/screens/Connect.tsx"
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import {
  Button,
  TextInput,
  QRCodeScanner,
} from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-jellyfish-components";
import { NavigationProp } from "@react-navigation/native";

interface ConnectScreenProps {
  navigation: NavigationProp<any>;
}

function ConnectScreen({ navigation }: ConnectScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  const [peerToken, setPeerToken] = useState<string>("");

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter peer token"
        value={peerToken}
        onChangeText={setPeerToken}
      />
      <Button
        onPress={() => {
          /* to be filled */
        }}
        title="Connect"
        disabled={!peerToken}
      />
      <QRCodeScanner onCodeScanned={setPeerToken} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    backgroundColor: "#BFE7F8",
    padding: 24,
    rowGap: 24,
  },
});

export default ConnectScreen;
```

### Connecting to the server

Once the UI is ready, let's implement connecting to the server.

Firstly wrap your app with `JelyfishContextProvider`:

```tsx "/App.tsx"
import React from "react";
// highlight-next-line
import { JellyfishContextProvider } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk";
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/native-stack";
import ConnectScreen from "./screens/Connect";
import RoomScreen from "./screens/Room";

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    // highlight-next-line
    <JellyfishContextProvider>
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator>
          <Stack.Screen name="Connect" component={ConnectScreen} />
          <Stack.Screen name="Room" component={RoomScreen} />
        </Stack.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
      // highlight-next-line
    </JellyfishContextProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Then in the `ConnectScreen` use the `useJellyfishClient` hook to connect to the
server. Simply call the `connect` method with your Jellyfish server URL and the
peer token. The `connect` function establishes a connection with the Jellyfish server
via web socket and authenticates the peer.

```tsx title="/screens/Connect.tsx"
// highlight-next-line
import { useJellyfishClient } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk";
import { NavigationProp } from "@react-navigation/native";

interface ConnectScreenProps {
  navigation: NavigationProp<any>;
}

// This is the address of the Jellyfish backend. Change the local IP to yours. We
// strongly recommend setting this as an environment variable, we hardcoded it here
// for simplicity.
// highlight-next-line
const JELLYFISH_URL = "ws://X.X.X.X:4000/socket/peer/websocket";

function ConnectScreen({ navigation }: ConnectScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  const [peerToken, setPeerToken] = useState<string>("");

  // highlight-next-line
  const { connect } = useJellyfishClient();

  // highlight-start
  const connectToRoom = async () => {
    try {
      await connect(JELLYFISH_URL, peerToken.trim());
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Error while connecting", e);
    }
  };
  // highlight-end
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter peer token"
        value={peerToken}
        onChangeText={setPeerToken}
      />
      // highlight-next-line
      <Button onPress={connectToRoom} title="Connect" disabled={!peerToken} />
      <QRCodeScanner onCodeScanned={setPeerToken} />
    </View>
  );
}

// ...
```

### Camera permissions (Android only)

To start the camera we need to ask the user for permission first. We'll use a
standard React Native module for this:

```tsx title="/screens/Connect.tsx"
import { View, StyleSheet, Permission, PermissionsAndroid } from "react-native";

// ...

function ConnectScreen({ navigation }: ConnectScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  // ...

  // highlight-start
  const grantedCameraPermissions = async () => {
    const granted = await PermissionsAndroid.request(
      PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.CAMERA as Permission
    );
    if (granted !== PermissionsAndroid.RESULTS.GRANTED) {
      console.error("Camera permission denied");
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  };
  // highlight-end

  const connectToRoom = async () => {
    try {
      await connect(JELLYFISH_URL, peerToken.trim());

      // highlight-start
      if (!(await grantedCameraPermissions())) {
        return;
      }
      // highlight-end
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Error while connecting", e);
    }
  };

  // ...
}

// ...
```

### Starting the camera

Jellyfish Client provides a handy hook for managing the camera: `useCamera`. It
can not only start a camera but also toggle, switch between multiple cameras,
manage camera state and camera track simulcast settings and bandwidth. Also when
starting the camera you can provide multiple different settings such as
resolution, quality, and metadata. In this example though we'll simply turn it
on to stream the camera to the dashboard with default settings:

```tsx title="/screens/Connect.tsx"
import {
  useJellyfishClient,
  // highlight-next-line
  useCamera,
} from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk";

// ...

function ConnectScreen({ navigation }: ConnectScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  const { startCamera } = useCamera();

  const connectToRoom = async () => {
    try {
      await connect(JELLYFISH_URL, peerToken.trim());

      if (!(await grantedCameraPermissions())) {
        return;
      }

      // highlight-next-line
      await startCamera();
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Error while connecting", e);
    }
  };

  // ...
}

// ...
```

### Joining the room

The last step of connecting to the room would be actually joining the room - so
that your camera track is visible to other users. To do this simply use the `join` function
from the `useJellyfishClient` hook.

You can also provide some user metadata when joining. You can put there whatever
you want, it depends on your business logic. In our example, we provide a user name.

After joining the room we navigate to the next screen: Room screen.

```tsx title="/screens/Connect.tsx"
// ...

function ConnectScreen({ navigation }: ConnectScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { connect, join } = useJellyfishClient();

  const connectToRoom = async () => {
    try {
      await connect(JELLYFISH_URL, peerToken.trim());

      if (!(await grantedCameraPermissions())) {
        return;
      }

      await startCamera();

      // highlight-next-line
      await join({ name: "Mobile RN Client" });
      // highlight-next-line
      navigation.navigate("Room");
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Error while connecting", e);
    }
  };

  // ...
}

// ...
```

Now the app is ready for the first test. If everything went well you should see
a video from your camera in the front-end dashboard. Now onto the second part:
displaying the streams from other participants.

## Displaying streams from other participants

### Displaying video tracks

The Room screen displays the video from the camera on your device and also
videos from other participants as well. It also allows the user to exit the call.

To get information about all participants (also the local one) in the room use
`usePeers()` hook from Jellyfish Client. The hook returns all the participants
with their ids, tracks and metadata. When a new participant joins or any
participant leaves or anything else changes, the hook updates with the new
information.

To display video tracks Jellyfish Client has a dedicated component for
displaying a video track: `<VideoRenderer>`. It takes a track id as a prop (it
may be a local or remote track) and you can style it just like an ordinary
`<View>`. You can even animate it!

So, let's display all the participants in the simplest way possible:

```tsx title="/screens/Room.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { NavigationProp, RouteProp } from "@react-navigation/native";
// highlight-start
import {
  usePeers,
  VideoRendererView,
} from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk";
// highlight-end

interface RoomScreenProps {
  navigation: NavigationProp<YourNavigatorParamList>;
}

function RoomScreen({ navigation }: RoomScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  // highlight-next-line
  const peers = usePeers();

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.videoContainer}>
        // highlight-start
        {peers.map((peer) =>
          peer.tracks[0] ? (
            <VideoRendererView
              trackId={peer.tracks[0].id}
              style={styles.video}
            />
          ) : null
        )}
        // highlight-end
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "space-between",
    backgroundColor: "#F1FAFE",
    padding: 24,
  },
  videoContainer: {
    flexDirection: "row",
    gap: 8,
    flexWrap: "wrap",
  },
  video: { width: 200, height: 200 },
});

export default RoomScreen;
```

You should now see your own camera on your mobile device. You can add another
participant and their new track (displaying for example rotating frog) in the dashboard like
this:

<ImageWrapper url={'/img/tutorials/adding_new_track.gif'}/>

It should show up in the Room screen automatically:

<ImageWrapper url={'/img/tutorials/room_screen.png'}/>

For your convenience in our components library we provided a component to layout
videos in a nice grid:

```tsx title="/screens/Room.tsx"
// highlight-next-line
import { VideosGrid } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-jellyfish-components";

// ...

function RoomScreen({ navigation }: RoomScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  const peers = usePeers();

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      // highlight-start
      <VideosGrid
        tracks={peers.map((peer) => peer.tracks[0]?.id).filter((t) => t)}
      />
      // highlight-end
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Gracefully leaving the room

To leave a room we'll add a button for the user. When the user clicks it, we
gracefully leave the room, close the server connection and go back to the
Connect screen.

For leaving the room and closing the server connection you can use the `cleanUp` method from the `useJellyfishClient()` hook.

After leaving the room we go back to the Connect screen.

```tsx title="/screens/Room.tsx"
// ...

import {
  usePeers,
  VideoRendererView,
  // highlight-next-line
  useJellyfishClient,
} from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-client-sdk";
// highlight-next-line
import { InCallButton } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-native-jellyfish-components";

// ...

function RoomScreen({ navigation }: RoomScreenProps): JSX.Element {
  const peers = usePeers();
  // highlight-start
  const { cleanUp } = useJellyfishClient();

  const onDisconnectPress = () => {
    cleanUp();
    navigation.goBack();
  };
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <VideosGrid
        tracks={peers.map((peer) => peer.tracks[0]?.id).filter((t) => t)}
      />
      // highlight-start
      <InCallButton
        type="disconnect"
        iconName="phone-hangup"
        onPress={onDisconnectPress}
      />
      // highlight-end
    </View>
  );
}

// ...
```

To launch your app, you can use the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ios" label="ios">

```bash
npm run ios
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="android">

```bash
npm run android
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Summary

Congrats on finishing your first Jellyfish mobile application! In this tutorial,
you've learned how to make a basic Jellyfish client application that streams and
receives video tracks with WebRTC technology.

But this was just the beginning. Jellyfish Client supports much more than just
streaming camera: it can also stream audio, screencast your device's screen,
configure your camera and audio devices, detect voice activity, control
simulcast, bandwidth and encoding settings, show camera preview, display WebRTC
stats and more to come. Check out our other tutorials to learn about those
features.

You can also take a look at our fully featured [Videoroom Demo
example](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/react-native-membrane-webrtc/tree/master/example):

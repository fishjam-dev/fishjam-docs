You can learn more about Jellyfish architecture in [Jellyfish
docs](/). This section provides a
brief description aimed at front-end developers

:::

Let's introduce some concepts first:

- **Peer** - A peer is a client-side entity that connects to the server to
  publish, subscribe or publish and subscribe to tracks published by components
  or other peers. You can think of it as a participant in a room. At the moment,
  there is only one type of peer - WebRTC.
- **Track** - An object that represents an audio or video stream. A track can be
  associated with a local media source, such as a camera or microphone, or a
  remote media source received from another user. Tracks are used to capture,
  transmit, and receive audio and video data in WebRTC applications.
- **Room** - In Jellyfish, a room serves as a holder for peers and components,
  its function varying based on application. From a front-end perspective, this will
  be probably one meeting or a broadcast.

For a better understanding of these concepts here is an example of a room that
holds a standard WebRTC conference from a perspective of the User:

![Room example](/img/tutorials/room_example.png)

In this example, peers stream multiple video and audio tracks. Peer #1 streams
even two video tracks (camera and screencast track). You can differentiate
between them by using track metadata. The user gets info about peers and their
tracks from the server using Jellyfish Client. The user is also informed in real
time about peers joining/leaving and tracks being added/removed.

To keep this tutorial short we'll simplify things a little. Every peer will stream just one
video track.

### Connecting and joining the room

The general flow of connecting to the server and joining the room in a standard
WebRTC conference setup looks like this:

The parts that you need to implement are marked in blue and things handled by
Jellyfish are marked in red.

Firstly, the user logs in. Then your backend authenticates the user and obtains
a peer token. It allows the user to authenticate and join the room in Jellyfish
Server. The backend passes the token to your front-end, and your front-end passes
it to Jellyfish Client. The client establishes the connection with Jellyfish
Server. Then Jellyfish Client sets up tracks (camera, microphone) to stream and
joins the room on Jellyfish Server. Finally, your front-end can display the room
for the user.

For this tutorial we simplified this process a bit - you don't have to implement
a backend or authentication. Jellyfish Dashboard will do this for you. It's also
a nice tool to test and play around with Jellyfish. The flow with Jellyfish
Dashboard looks like this:

You can see that the only things you need to implement are interactions with the
user and Jellyfish Client. This tutorial will show you how to do it.

# React Minimal Working Example

## What you'll learn

This tutorial will guide you through creating your first React project that uses the Jellyfish Client.
By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a working web application that connects to
[Jellyfish Media Server](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish) using WebRTC technology.

You can check out the finished project [here](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish-clients-tutorials/tree/main/JellyfishDashboardReact/JellyfishDashboard)

## What do you need

- a little bit of experience in creating React apps
- IDE of your choice (for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine

## Jellyfish architecture

<JellyfishArchitecture />

## Setup

### Create React + Vite project

Firstly create a brand new project.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="vite" label="Vite">

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add dependencies

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="react" label="React">
    For this module to work you'll need to add our `react-client-sdk` package. This
    is necessary to create and connect Jellyfish Client.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk#0.1.2
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start the Jellyfish backend

<StartingJellyfishBackend />

### Start the dashboard web front-end

<StartingJellyfishDashboard />

## (Optional) Add a bit of CSS styling

For this project, we prepared simple [CSS classes](https://github.com/Crackhoff/jellyfish-clients-tutorials/blob/main/JellyfishDashboardReact/JellyfishDashboard/src/styles.css),
You are free to use it or create your own.

## General project structure

Our app will consist of two parts:

- a component that will connect to the server and join the room

- a component that will display the video tracks from other participants

## First step - prepare all the hooks and the context

To connect to the Jellyfish backend, we need to create a Membrane Client
instance. We can do it by using the `create` function from the
`@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk` package. It needs two generic parameters:

- `PeerMetadata` - the type of metadata that will be sent to the server when
  connecting to the room (for example, user name) it has to be serializable

- `TrackMetadata` - the type of the metadata that will be sent to the server when
  sending a track (for example, track name) it has to be serializable as well

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { create } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk";

// Example metadata types for peer and track
// You can define your metadata types just make sure they are serializable
type PeerMetadata = {
  name: string;
};

type TrackMetadata = {
  type: "camera" | "screen";
};

// Create a Jellyfish client instance
// Since we will use this context outside of the component we need to export it
export const {
  JellyfishContextProvider, // Context provider
} = create<PeerMetadata, TrackMetadata>();

export const App = () => {};
```

### Now we need to wrap our app with the context provider

That's all we will need to do in this file. Simply import the `JellyfishContextProvider` along with the `App`
component and wrap the `App` component with the `JellyfishContextProvider`:

```tsx title="main.tsx"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { App, JellyfishContextProvider } from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <JellyfishContextProvider>
      <App />
    </JellyfishContextProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## UI component that will connect to the server and join the room

The UI of the component will be quite simple. It will consist of a simple text input field
that will allow us to enter the peer token and a button that
will connect to the server and join the room. We can also display the status of the connection.

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import React, { useState } from "react";
//...
export const App = () => {
  // Create a state to store the peer token
  const [token, setToken] = useState("");
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: "8px" }}>
    <input value={token} onChange={(e) => setToken(() => e?.target?.value)} placeholder="token" />
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", gap: "8px" }}>

       <button
          disabled={}
          onClick={() => {}};
        >
          Connect
        </button>
        <button
          disabled={}
          onClick={() => {}};
        >
          Disconnect
        </button>
        <span>Status: {}</span>
    </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Once the UI is ready, we need to implement the logic

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { SignalingUrl } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk/.";
//...
export const {
  // highlight-start
  useStatus, // Hook to check the status of the connection
  useConnect, // Hook to connect to the server
  useDisconnect, // Hook to disconnect from the server
  // highlight-end
  JellyfishContextProvider, // Context provider
};
export const App = () => {
  // Create a state to store the peer token
  const [token, setToken] = useState("");
  // Use the built-in hook to check the status of the connection
  const status = useStatus();
  const connect = useConnect();
  const disconnect = useDisconnect();
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: "8px" }}>
      <input
        className="input-field"
        value={token}
        onChange={(e) => setToken(() => e?.target?.value)}
        placeholder="token"
      />
      <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", gap: "8px" }}>
        <button
          className="button"
          disabled={token === "" || status === "joined"} // simple check to avoid errors
          onClick={() => {
            // highlight-start
            connect({
              peerMetadata: { name: "John Doe" }, // example metadata
              token: token,
            });
            // highlight-end
          }}
        >
          Connect
        </button>
        <button
          className="button"
          disabled={status !== "joined"}
          onClick={() => {
            // highlight-next-line
            disconnect();
          }}
        >
          Disconnect
        </button>
        // highlight-next-line
        <span className="span-status">Status: {status}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Great! Now we can connect to the server and join the room. But we still need to
add some logic to send our tracks to the server and receive tracks from others.

### Let's send our screen to the server

This hook uses [Navigator.mediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mediaDevices) take a look how it works

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { create, SCREEN_SHARING_MEDIA_CONSTRAINTS } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk";
import { SignalingUrl, Peer } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk/.";
//...
export const {
  useStatus, // Hook to check the status of the connection
  // highlight-next-line
  useApi, // Hook to get the webrtcApi reference
  useConnect, // Hook to connect to the server
  useDisconnect, // Hook to disconnect from the server
  JellyfishContextProvider, // Context provider
} = create<PeerMetadata, TrackMetadata>();

export const App = () => {
  //...
  // Get the webrtcApi reference
  const webrtcApi = useApi();

   function startScreenSharing() {
      // Get screen sharing MediaStream
            navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia(SCREEN_SHARING_MEDIA_CONSTRAINTS).then((screenStream) => {
              // Add local MediaStream to webrtc
              screenStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => webrtcApi.addTrack(track, screenStream, { type: "screen" }));
    };
   };
   return (
  //...
  <button
  className="button"
    disabled={status !== "joined"}
    onClick={() => {
      startScreenSharing();
    }}
  >
    Start screen share
  </button>
  <span>Status: {status}</span>
  //...
  )
};
```

You should now see your screen received for each connected client on the dashboard. You can add another participant to check this out!

The streaming part of the app is ready!

## What about the receiving part?

### This is where the second component comes in handy

For each track received, we will create a new video element and display it on the screen. For clarity, we will separate this component into another file:

Create in your directory file `VideoPlayer.tsx`

```tsx title="VideoPlayer.tsx"
type Props = {
  stream: MediaStream | null | undefined;
};

const VideoPlayer = ({ stream }: Props) => {
  return (
    <div className="video-container">
      <video autoPlay playsInline muted ref={/* place for track ref*/} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default VideoPlayer;
```

### Now the logic for the component

```tsx title="VideoPlayer.tsx"
type Props = {
  stream: MediaStream | null | undefined;
};

const VideoPlayer = ({ stream }: Props) => {
  const videoRef: RefObject<HTMLVideoElement> = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!videoRef.current) return;
    videoRef.current.srcObject = stream || null;
  }, [stream]);

  return (
    <div>
      <video autoPlay playsInline muted ref={videoRef} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default VideoPlayer;
```

### Now we can use it in our main component

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { create, SCREEN_SHARING_MEDIA_CONSTRAINTS } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk";
import { SignalingUrl, Peer } from "@jellyfish-dev/react-client-sdk/.";
import VideoPlayer from "./VideoPlayer";
//...

export const {
 useStatus, // Hook to check the status of the connection
  // highlight-next-line
  useTracks, // Hook to get the tracks from the server
  useApi, // Hook to get the webrtcApi reference
  useConnect, // Hook to connect to the server
  useDisconnect, // Hook to disconnect from the server
  JellyfishContextProvider, // Context provider
} = create<PeerMetadata, TrackMetadata>();
export const App = () => {
  const tracks = useTracks();
  //...
  <div
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          flexWrap: "wrap",
          justifyContent: "center", // To align items in the center
          gap: "20px",
        }}
      >
  {Object.values(tracks).map(({ stream, trackId }) => (
        <VideoPlayer key={trackId} stream={stream} /> // pass the stream to the component
      ))}
  </div>
  //...
  )
```

You should see all the tracks sent from the dashboard directly on your page, to test them, add a new client, and add a track (for example a rotating frog). It will show up in your app automatically:

## Summary

Congrats on finishing your first Jellyfish web application! In this tutorial,
You've learned how to make a basic Jellyfish client application that streams your screen and
receives video tracks with WebRTC technology.

But this was just the beginning. Jellyfish Client supports much more than just
streaming camera: It can also stream audio or your device's camera,
configure your camera and audio devices, detect voice activity, control
simulcast, bandwidth and encoding settings, show camera preview, display WebRTC
stats and more to come. Check out our other tutorials to learn about those
features.

# Installation

There are two ways of running Jellyfish:
* building from source (requires Elixir and native dependencies)
* using Jellyfish Docker images

At the moment, Jellyfish doesn't provide pre-built binaries.

## Building from source

Make sure to have Elixir installed. If not, you can do it [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

**Clone the Jellyfish repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish.git
```

**Install native dependencies**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac-intel" label="macOS Intel" default>

  ```
  brew install srtp libnice clang-format ffmpeg opus pkg-config
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
  export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include/"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include/"
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac-m1" label="macOS Apple Silicon" default>

  ```
  brew install srtp libnice clang-format ffmpeg opus
  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libnice/0.1.18/include:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opus/1.3.1/include:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1l_1/include
  export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opus/1.3.1/lib
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1l_1/lib/pkgconfig/
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu" default>

  ```
  sudo apt-get install libsrtp2-dev libnice-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libopus-dev
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Install elixir dependencies**

```
mix deps.get
```

**Run the server in development**
```
mix phx.server
```

## Running with Docker

Docker images are built for production which means that you always
need to set a couple of environment variables.
See [Env variables](#env-variables) for more.

```console
docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=localhost \
           -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=secret \
           -e TOKEN=token \
           ghcr.io/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish:latest
```

For the full list of Jellyfish Docker images, [see this page](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/jellyfish/pkgs/container/jellyfish).

:::tip

Instead of passing environmental variables manually, you can use the `--env-file ./env-file` flag, where the `env-file` is a file containing the variables that the image expects, see example file `.env.sample` in the Jellyfish repository.

## Env variables

Below there are general, Jellyfish environment variables.
If you are running Jellyfish in development, you don't need to 
set any of them.

Besides Jellyfish environment variables, each Peer and Component 
can expose its own environment variables.
They are always listed in a Peer/Component description.
See the list of [Peers](./peers/webrtc.md) and [Components](./components/hls.md).

* `MIX_ENV` - defines compilation mode.
This variable takes effect only when running from source.
Docker images are built with `MIX_ENV=prod`.
Possible values are:
  * `dev` - uses default values for environment variables 
  (default option when running with `mix phx.server`)
  * `prod` - requires you to provide values for environment variables
  * `test` - used in tests
* `TOKEN` - token for authorizing HTTP requests. Defaults to `development` for
development builds.
* `AUTH_SALT` - used to sign/encrypt tokens generated for Peers.
* `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - used to sign/encrypt cookies and other secrets.
* `VIRTUAL_HOST` - host passed to the endpoint config. Defaults to `example.com` for production builds.
* `PORT` - port to run the HTTP server. Defaults to `4000` both for development and production builds.

Your Backend (BE) - serves your application frontend, and manages the database and application-specific logic. Jellyfish (JF) - Jellyfish media server. Manages media. Admin - someone who has special permission in your application - can create/delete rooms, add/remove peers, etc. User - someone who connects to Jellyfish to send and receive media. Everything starts with Admin who sends an HTTP request to BE to create a new room.BE uses jellyfish-server-sdk to communicate with JF and create the room. Under the hood, jellyfish-server-sdk uses REST API exposed by JF. After the room has been created, the Admin invites a user by sending a new HTTP request to BE. Again, BE uses jellyfish-server-sdk to add the new peer to JF. On the user side, they send a request to BE to join the room.BE replies with JF IP address it should connect to. Then, the User uses jellyfish-client-sdk to connect to JF. After the connection has been established, the User can send and receive media.

How does it work? Both Jellyfish and Business Logic are configured with the same secret. This secret is used for authorizing HTTP requests between them (via HTTP authorization request header). When a new client wants to join a room, Business Logic (assuming the client is authorized to join) requests adding a new peer and receives a token generated by Jellyfish. The token must then be passed to the client, that will use it to connect to the room as a new peer. The token encodes both peer and room IDs. The token exchange is handled by our Client SDKs when connecting. Under the hood, Jellyfish expects the token in the first message after opening the Web Socket connection. Token encodes peer id and room id.

IP cameras very often use RTSP for streaming media but browsers don't ship with support for this protocol. Therefore, to display audio and video in a web browser, we have to use either WebRTC or HLS. Because, in this scenario, the delay is not the most crucial thing, we choose HLS. The most important thing here is that the RTSP component connects to the IP camera and then the camera starts streaming. It's not the camera that initializes the connection to the server. Therefore, the RTSP component is a purely server-side thing - once you add it, it should be able to work on its own.
